    This field indicates whether skill has understood the slot value. In most typical cases, skills will do some form of entity resolution by looking up a catalog or list to determine whether they recognize the slot or not. Return YES if skill have a perfect match or high confidence match (for eg. synonyms) with catalog or list maintained by skill. Return NO if skill cannot understand or recognize the slot value. Return MAYBE if skill have partial confidence or partial match. This will be true when the slot value doesn’t exist as is, in the catalog, but a variation or a fuzzy match may exist. For specific recommendations to set the value refer to the developer docs for more details.
